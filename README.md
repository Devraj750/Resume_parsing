Resume_parsing :
This project is an AI-based web application that analyzes a candidate's resume and compares it with a job description to generate a match score, helping job seekers understand how well their profile fits a particular role.Built using Python, NLP techniques, and Streamlit, this tool automates resume screening using cosine similarity and TF-IDF vectorization. Users can upload PDFs of their resume and job descriptions to get instant, intelligent feedback on alignment.

Use this to run the code [ streamlit run app.py ]
